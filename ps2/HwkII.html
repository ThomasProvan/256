<h1>Homework I
</h1>

<h2>
Due Thursday, January 30.
</h2>

<p>
<b> Needed background: </b>  Except for Problem 3, you only need
lecture material up through Chapter 9, on mixture distributions.
Problem 2 requires knowledge of covariance matrices and random
vectors, so you'll need to read Chapter 13.  In Problem 3, you'll need
the first few pages of Chapter 10, which will be covered in lecture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Reminder:</b>  A simulation <i>simulates</i>.  In the problems below,
I have you write simulation code to check your math derivation.  If your
simulation in Problem 1, for example, were to make use of (9.6), it wouldn't 
be an independent check of your math; be sure your simulation simulates the
process being modeled, rather than being a full or partial rehash of the
math.
</p>

<h2>Problem 1</h2>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> In the coin-flips-with-bonus example in Section 9.5,
use the Law of Total Variance to find Var(X), where X is the total
number of heads, regardless of whether bonus or nonbonus.  
Use simulation (ordinary, not DES) to find the variance AND the mean EX.  
Recall that there is a more detailed derivation <a
href="Bonus.pdf">here</a>.
</li> </p> 

<li> Do the same as in part (a), for the trapped-miner example, Section
9.4, finding Var(Y), where Y is the time needed to reach safety.  In the 
<a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/PLN/ProbStatBook.pdf">
constantly updated version of our book</a>, I've added more detail for
this example too.
</li> </p> 

</OL> </p>

<h2>Problem 2</h2>

<p> This problem involves the Law of Total Variance, Equation (9.8) 
in our book.  
</p>

<p> The first part of this problem will consist of finding, and
<i>understanding</i>, a proof of (9.8).  There are many on the Web,
including on Wikipedia.  They all make use of the famous relation, 
</p>

<p>
Var(Z) = E(Z<sup>2</sup>) - (EZ)<sup>2</sup>  
</p>

<p>
I generally like Wikipedia (I use it myself), but in this case their 
proof is confusing.  Among other things, it's sloppy about the use of 
parentheses, dropping them sometimes when needed.  The derivation <a
href="http://math.la.asu.edu/~jtaylor/teaching/Fall2010/STP421/lectures/lecture24.pdf">here</a>
is more careful.  You may find it helpful to write something like
Q = E(Y | X), as I have in the book and in class.
</p>

<p>
So, first make sure you understand the derivation.  I am asking you to
go to the Web for this, because I want you to have experience in finding
and understanding research results on the Web.  (You do not write up
this part of the problem; it's just for preparation for parts (a) and
(b) below.)
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Derive the extension of (9.8) for vector-valued Y:
</p>

<p>
Cov(Y) = E[Cov(Y | X)] + Cov[E(Y | X)]
</p>

<p>
where Cov() denotes the covariance matrix of a random vector.
</p>

<p>
Your derivation must be use matrix expressions only, instead of
analyzing individual elements.  You should find Equation (13.53)
especially helpful; note that it is the analog of
</p>

<p>
Var(Z) = E(Z<sup>2</sup>) - (EZ)<sup>2</sup>  
</p>
</li> </p>

<li> Use the formula you derive in (a) to find &rho;(X,Y) in Section
9.5, where X is the total number of heads and Y is number of nonbonus
heads.  (That function name is "rho," not "p"; it denotes correlation.)
Confirm via simulation.
</li> </p> 


</OL> </p>

<h2>Problem 3</h2>

<p>
Consider a discrete-time Markov chain with finite state space and
stationary distribution &pi;.  Suppose the states indicate the quantity
of something, e.g. the amount of inventory in the model in Sec. 4.7.
(All of the examples in Chapter 4 have numeric states.)  Assume
that the initial state X<sub>0</sub> is random, with distribution &pi;.  
Note that that implies that X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ... will 
all have this distribution.  
</p>

<p>
Write an R function with call form
</p>

<pre>
mccor(tm,k)
</pre>

<p>
that finds &rho;(X<sub>i</sub>,X<sub>i+j</sub>), j = 1,2,...,k.  
(Be sure you understand that this quantity does not depend on i.)
The return value will be a k-element vector.
</p>

<p>
Note:  Do not use simulation.  Your code must calculate the exact
correlations.
