<h2>Problem 1:</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns <i>discrete event simulation</i> (DES), used to 
simulate queuing, inventory systems and so on.  The word <i>discrete</i> 
refers to the fact that events occurred suddenly, rather than gradually.  
For instance, a new job arrives and is queued, so the queue length suddenly
increases by 1.
</p>

<p>
There are two main programmer world views for DES, <i>event-oriented</i>
and <i>process-oriented</i>.  The latter is in my opinion clearer, as it
is similar to a threads model, but it is slower and more difficult to
implement.  We will use the event-oriented approach.
</p>

<p>
You will use the code <a href="../../132/DES/DES.R">DES.R</a>, which is a
modification of an example from my R programming book.  The comments 
in the file, together with the example at the end of the file, should 
make it clear how to use the code.  
</p>

<p>
If you wish (NOT required), you can look at my
<a href="../../simcourse.html">online course in DES</a>, which uses the
<a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">SimPy library</a>, a
Python-based, process-oriented system.  Some of the examples in my
online course there are like the machine repair problems here, though 
again using the other world view.  
</p>

<p>
DES programming can be rather difficult, especially during
debugging.  Make sure you are adept at using R debugging tools. 
</p>

<p>
DES code can also be slow.  For an overview and some solutions, see
Revisiting the Issue of Performance Enhancement of Discrete Event
Simulation Software (A. Bahouth, S. Crites, N. Matloff, and T.
Williamson), <i> Proceedings of the 40th Anuual Simulation
Symposium</i>, 2007, 114-122.  This may be useful to you in the
<strong>Extra Credit</strong> problem below.
</p>

<p>
One more important point:  Some of the parts of this problem appear much
easier than they actually are.  So, be sure to 
<strong>
start early!
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Here you will simulate the machine repair example in Section 8.4 of our
book.
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Write DES code to verify (8.13).  Your code should use general
values of the parameters, e.g. not hard-code the 25.0, including general
numbers of machines.
</li> </p>

<li> Consider <b>w</b>, the long-run average number of working machines.
</p>

   <UL>

   <li> Find <b>w</b> mathematically as a function of the &pi;<sub>i</sub>. 
   </li> </p> 

   <li> Extend your code in (a) to verify this value of <b>w</b> by simulation.
   (Be careful with this.)
   </li> </p>

   </UL>

<li> Now suppose it takes <b>c</b> amount of time for the 
repairperson to be summoned when a breakdown occurs, and that only 
one machine can be repaired at once.  Here <b>c</b> is a constant, 
not a random variable.  
</p>

<p>
This quantity <strong>c</strong> models the travel time for the
repairperson to reach the machine site.  Thus, if upon completion of 
a repair, there are other machines to be repaired, we do NOT have to
wait <strong>c</strong> time for the next repair to begin.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, what if there are no more repairs to do, so the
repairperson starts back to his office, but suddenly a machine goes
down while he is en route?  Shouldn't the model have a delay of less
than <strong>c</strong>?  For that matter, shouldn't <strong>c</strong>
be modeled as a random variable, to reflect random traffic conditions
and so on?  The answers of course are Yes.  But the complexity of a
model can quickly get out of hand!  Trust me--you don't want it to get
too complex in a homework assignment. :-)
</p>

Extend your code in (a) to handle this, computing the new values of 
the &pi;<sub>i</sub>.  Run it with a few values of c, graphing your 
results (you must use an R package, such as <strong>ggplot2</strong>).
</li> </p>

<li> 
<strong>
Extra Credit:
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Replace the R function <strong>binsearch()</strong> in <strong>DES.R</strong>
by a C or C++ function that hopefully will be faster.  Interface the 
rest of <strong>DES.R</strong> to this C/C++ via either 
<strong>.C()</strong>, <strong>.Call()</strong> (built-in R functions) or
<strong>Rcpp</strong>.  (The latter has become extremely popular, so you
may wish to give it a try.)  Devise a timing experiment in which the
events list is usually long, comparing the original <strong>DES.R</strong>
to your version.  (Do NOT change the rest of <strong>DES.R</strong>.)
</p>

</OL> </p>

<h2>Problem 2:</h2>

<p> Here we model a call center, say staffed with advice nurses for the
Kaiser medical system.  Say the number of nurses in the center varies
over time, according to demand.  When fewer calls come in, we reduce the
number of nurses--we'll call this going inactive--and increase the
number when demand rises.  
</p>

<p>
Let A<sub>t</sub> denote the number of active nurses at time t (either
currently talking to a patient or available to handle a new call).
We'll posit the following rules.
</p>

<UL>

<li> There is a limit of <strong>n</strong> active nurses.  So,
A<sub>t</sub> can never be less than 1 or greater than
<strong>n</strong>.  This will apply implicitly to the rules below.
</li> </p>

<li> Whenever a nurse finishes a call, he/she takes the first queued
call, if any.  If instead the queue is empty, that nurse goes inactive. 
</li> </p> 

<li> There is a limit of <strong>q</strong> queued calls.  If a call
arrives when the queue is full, a new nurse is moved into active mode. 
The new nurse takes the first queued call,
but that latest incoming call is rejected, with a message, "Sorry, we
cannot take your call..."
</li> </p> 

<li> Both <strong>n</strong> and <strong>q</strong> are assumed greater
than 1.
</li> </p>

</UL>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> 
In this part of the problem, we'll assume that call duration and 
interarrival time between calls are exponentially distributed with means
<strong>d</strong> and <strong>r</strong>, respectively.  
The system is then a continuous-time Markov process with states (i,j),
where i is the number of active nurses and j is the length of the queue.
Note the double subscripting that this implies for the stationary
probabilities and the double-double subscripts on the transition
probabilities p.
</p>

<p> 
Find the following, in terms of the parameters and the stationary
probabilities &pi;:
</p>

   <UL>
   
   <li> Write a few of the balance equations (8.5), in terms of the
   parameters stated above, for representative states.  (In other
   words, show the different patterns, but don't show duplicates.)
   Note that we will now write things like &pi;<sub>(i,j)</sub> and
   p<sub>(i,j),(k,l)</sub>.
   </li> </p>
   
   <li> Find the proportion of rejected calls.
   </li> </p>
   
   <li> Find the proportion of nurse idle time (no call in progress, but
   available to take calls)) while active.
   </li> </p> 
   
   <li> Find the mean time spent in state (1,1), i.e. the long-run average
   duration of the periods in which we are in that state.
   </li> </p>
   
   <li> Suppose the system has been running for a long time, and you are
   told that currently the queue is empty.  Find the probability that
   X<sub>t</sub> is greater than 1.
   </li> </p> 
   
   </UL>


<li> Continue the above assumptiions, except that the policy is 
now to reduce the number of nurses by 1 whenever <strong>p</strong > 
amount of time passes without a new call arriving.  This replaces the 
criterion of the queue becoming empty.  
</p>

<p>
Note that due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution
family, this new criterion wouldn't make sense in that context.  So,
here we will assume that the interarrival distribution is uniform on
(0,2<strong>r</strong>).
</p>

<p>
Write code using <strong> DES.R</strong> to simulate this, outputting 
the first 2 quantities above (proportion of rejected calls, nurse idle time).
